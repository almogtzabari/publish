Follow these steps: Set up FFmpeg on your Windows machine . Copy the files you wish to merge to the bin folder (explained here in section 2). Create a simple text file called mylist.txt inside the bin directory. Each line within this file should contain the word file and then the name of your file. For example: file 'my_first_file.mp4' file 'my_second_file.mp4' file 'my_last_file.mp4' Save the text file and close it.
