Follow these steps in order to create a code block in Google Docs:
1. Create an table of size `1x1`.
2. Fill the background color of that cell with a color similar to the IDE.
3. Copy the desired code from within the IDE and paste it into that cell. This should copy the code with the IDE's background color and syntax highlights.
